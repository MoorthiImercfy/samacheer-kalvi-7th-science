VIII. Long Answer,1,How will you find the volume of an irregularly shaped object (stone) by using measuring cylinder?,"1. Take a measuring cylinder and pour some water into it.
2. Note down the volume of water from the readings of the measuring cylinder.
3. Take it as V1
4. Now take a small stone and tie it with a thread.
5. Immerse the stone inside the water by holding the thread.
6. This has to be done such that the stone does not touch the walls of the measuring cylinder.
7. Now the level of water has raised.
8. Note down the volume of water and take it to be V2

The volume of the stone is equal to the raise in the volume of water.
V1 = 30cc, V2 = 40cc
Volume of stone = V2 – V1 = 40 – 30 = 10cc"

IX. Problems for practice,1,A piece of iron weighs 230 g and has a volume of 20 cm3. Find the density of iron.,"Mass of iron (m) = 230 g
Volume of iron (v) = 20 cm3
Density = Mass/Volume = 230/20 = 11.5 g/cm3"

IX. Problems for practice,2,Find the mass of silver of volume 50 cm3 and density 10.5 g/cm3,"Mass of silver (M) = ?
Volume of silver (V) = 50 cm3
Density of silver D = 10.5 g/cm3
mass (M) = Density × Volume
= 10.5 x 50 = 525 g"

X. HOTS,1,Why does an iron needle sink in water, but not an iron ship?,,"Iron needle is compact and its density is 7.6 g/cm3 Thus, as the density of iron needle is more than 1 g/cm3 therefore, it sinks in water. However, the iron ship is constructed in such a way that it is mostly hollow from within, thus, the volume of iron ship becomes very large as compared to its mass and hence its density is less than lg/cm3. As the density of iron ship is less than 1g/cm3, therefore it floats in water."
